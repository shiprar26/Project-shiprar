Task 2 - This project involves setting up a PostgreSQL database to manage student information. It includes creating tables, inserting data, retrieving information based on various criteria, updating records, performing group-based calculations, and renaming tables. The project demonstrates fundamental database operations and SQL queries, showcasing how a database management system can be used to efficiently handle and manipulate student data.
Task 3 -Outline the fundamental operations and queries necessary to implement an Event Management System using PostgreSQL. Each task focuses on managing event data, attendee information, and registration records efficiently.
Task 4 - demonstrates how each OLAP operation can be implemented in SQL to analyze sales data across different dimensions (product, region, date) using PostgreSQL or Redshift.
